// Write data to the connection. The amount of data may be zero.
// A note about writing:
// - LWIP is compiled with option LWIP_NETIF_TX_SINGLE_PBUF set. A comment says this is mandatory for the ESP8266.
// - A side effect of this is that when we call tcp_write, the data is always copied even if we don't set the TCP_WRITE_FLAG_COPY flag.
// - The PBUFs used to copy the outgoing data into are always large enough to accommodate the MSS. The total allocation size per PBUF is 1560 bytes.
// - Sending a full 2K of data may require 2 of these PBUFs to be allocated.
// - Due to memory fragmentation and other pending packets, this allocation is sometimes fails if we are serving more than 2 files at a time.
// - The result returned by tcp_sndbuf doesn't take account of the possibility that this allocation may fail.
// - When it receives a write request from the Duet main processor, our socket server has to say how much data it can accept before accepting it.
// - So in version 1.21 it sometimes happened that we accept some data based on the amount that tcp_sndbuf say we can, but we can't actually send it.
// - We then terminate the connection, and the client request fails.
// To mitigate this we could:
// - Have one overflow write buffer, shared between all connections
// - Only accept write data from the Duet main processor if the overflow buffer is free
// - If after accepting data from the Duet main processor we find that we can't send it, we send some of it if we can and store the rest in the overflow buffer
// - Then we push any pending data that we already have, and in Poll() we try to send the data in overflow buffer
// - When the overflow buffer is empty again, we can start accepting write data from the Duet main processor again.
// A further mitigation would be to restrict the amount of data we accept so some amount that will fit in the MSS, then tcp_write will need to allocate at most one PBUF.
// However, another reason why tcp_write can fail is because MEMP_NUM_TCP_SEG is set too low in Lwip. It now appears that this is the maoin cause of files tcp_write
// call in version 1.21. So I have increased it from 10 to 16, which seems to have fixed the problem..
